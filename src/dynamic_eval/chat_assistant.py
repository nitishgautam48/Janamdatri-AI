"""
Instant Help Chat Assistant - rule-based (no external LLM dependency, so
it works offline and needs no API key), sharing the same danger-sign
detection this app's assessment flow already uses. If a message matches a
WHO danger sign, safety comes first: the bot responds with an emergency
escalation and does not try to be a general FAQ bot for that turn - the
way a trained health-worker helpline would triage a call before chatting.

This is a scripted assistant, not a real conversational AI - it matches
keywords into a fixed set of intents. It exists to get a woman a useful,
instant answer (or an emergency escalation) at 2am when no health worker
is reachable, not to replace one. "Training" it means widening its
phrase coverage and adding a graceful clarifying-question fallback for
vague distress language ("I'm in pain", "I don't feel well") that isn't
specific enough to match a category on its own - asking a follow-up
question is far more useful than a flat "I didn't understand that."
